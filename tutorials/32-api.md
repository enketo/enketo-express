**Always** use the API to obtain webform URLs. Never try to craft or manipulate Enketo webform URLs yourself. This will make your Enketo integration future proof in case the URL structure changes. The API is stable, but webform URLs definitely are not.

The API is accessible on **/api/v2** and **/api/v1**. See the [documentation](http://apidocs.enketo.org) on how to use it.
