Comment Feature
============

The comment feature is an Enketo extension to the OpenRosa XForm spec that allows form designers to add a comment widget to individual questions. If funding allows this could quite easily be extended further by adding a comment to a group or the form as a whole.

This feature has the following characteristics:
- A comment is coded in XForms like a separate question. It has it's own XML data node. This means that XPath can be used to add form logic that references this question, e.g. a dynamic "required" expression that specifies that a particular question is required unless it has a comment.
- The `for` attribute, in the _http://enketo.org/xforms_ namespace, is used on the `<bind>` element to point a comment node to a question node. 
- An appearance is used to instantiate the widget. Without this appearance the comment input would show up as a regular question.
- Optionally a custom-namespaced attribute could be added to the data node in the model in the XForm definition. Enketo will not use that information but it could be helpful to link user-entered data with a comment in the analysis.


This feature is not meant to be hand-coded into an XLSForm or XForm, as it quite tedious (but it can be done). It is meant to be added to advanced XLSForm or XForm form builders.

### How to use

To add a comment widget to a question, the following needs to be defined in the XLSForm:

#### Namespace

In XLSForm on the settings sheet, add a column `namespaces` and populate this with `enk=http://enketo.org/xforms`.

| form_title | namespaces                     |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| My Form    | enk="http://enketo.org/xforms" |


#### Question

Add a question of type `text`, optionally with appearance `multiline`, preferably immediately after the question node it refers to (for future printability of records).

| type | name      | label           | appearance |
|------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| text | a         | Enter text      |            |
| text | a_comment | Enter a comment | multiline  |

#### Appearance

Give this question the appearance `comment` to ensure the question will be displayed as a comment widget. 

| type | name      | label           | appearance        |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| text | a         | Enter text      |                   |
| text | a_comment | Enter a comment | multiline comment |


#### Add a bind::enk:for column

For each discrepancy note question, add a reference to the question node it refers to in the `bind::enk:for` column, e.g. `${a}`. The prefix `enk` corresponds with the namespace prefix added on the settings sheet.

| type | name      | label           | appearance   | bind::enk:for |
|------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| text | a         | Enter text      |              |               |
| text | a_comment | Enter a comment | multiline comment | ${a}			|

#### Dynamic required

Optionally, if you'd like to make question "a" required only if there is no comment, you could use the regular XLSForm/XPath syntax. Nothing new here. You could do the same for relevant and constraint logic too.

| type | name      | label           | appearance   | bind::enk:for | required        |
|------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| text | a         | Enter text      |              |               | $a_comment = '' |
| text | a_comment | Enter a comment | multiline comment | ${a}			|                 |
