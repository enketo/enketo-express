# Enketo Express

_The [Enketo Smart Paper](https://enketo.org) web application._ It can be used directly by form servers or used as inspiration for building applications that wrap [Enketo Core](https://github.com/enketo/enketo-core). See [this diagram](https://enketo.org/develop/) for a summary of how the different Enketo components are related.

**To get started visit our [technical documentation](https://enketo.github.io/enketo-express).**

### Project status

Enketo was initiated in 2009 by Martijn van de Rijdt as a web-based alternative or complement to [ODK Collect](https://docs.getodk.org/collect-intro/). It has become a core component of the ODK ecosystem and been adopted by several organizations beyond that ecosystem.

As of 2022, Enketo is maintained by the [ODK team](https://getodk.org/about/team.html) (primarily [Trevor Schmidt](https://github.com/eyelidlessness/)). Martijn continues to provide advice and continuity. The ODK project sets priorities in collaboration with its [Technical Advisory Board](https://getodk.org/about/ecosystem.html).

Our current primary goals are:

-   Increasing alignment with ODK Collect, particularly in service of submission edits.
-   Improving error messages so that users can get out of bad states.
-   Improving long-term maintainability by modernizing code bases, removing code duplication, and simplifying state mutation.

Feature requests and project discussion are welcome on the [ODK forum](https://forum.getodk.org/).
